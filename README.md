# tombstone


A compiler and documentation for a programming language, "Tombstone."

I wrote this compiler and language about two years ago. I did it in 2-3 months during my sophomore year of High School.

I am rather embarrassed of this project, but I feel the need to publicly archive it, for whatever reason.
