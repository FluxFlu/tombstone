<h>What is an include statement</h>

Include statements are used to import both data from both the standard library and from other files

<h>How to include something</h>

Include statements follow the syntax of <cb> #include `original name` from `location` as `name` with `parameters` returns `return value` </cb>

It is important to note that when including from the standard library you use `&lt;location&gt;` whereas when including from a relative file you use "location".

For example, to include the standard library function print from stdio, one would use <cb> #include print from &lt;stdio&gt; as print with [str] </cb>

<h>Example of a full code block using that include</h>
</p>
<pre>

#include print from &lt;stdio&gt; as print with [str]

export impure fn main = () => {
    str x = "Hello, world!";
    print(x); <comment>// Prints "Hello, world!"</comment>
}

</pre>
<p>

As you can see, <cb> print(str) </cb> is included into the file, and it is then used to print a string.

<h>Trusting that included values are pure</h>

By default, values are considered impure when included from the standard library or included from .tmb files where they are declared as impure.

In order to treat a value as pure, use <cb> #trust include </cb> instead of just <cb> #include </cb>.
