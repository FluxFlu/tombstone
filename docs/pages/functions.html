            Functions:
        </p>
<p>
A function is a data type that contains code which can be run by "calling" the function.

To declare a function, use "fn"

For example,

</p>
<pre>
fn main = () => {
    <comment>// Any code included here is a part of the function!</comment>
}
</pre>
<p>
The syntax for the function datatype is as follows: <cb> `return_type` (...`parameters`) => {`code`} </cb>

For example,

</p>
<pre>
<comment>// This function accepts an i32 and an i64, and it returns the result of adding them, in the form of an i64. </comment>
fn main = i64 (i32 x, i64 y) => {
    return x + y;
}
</pre>
<p>

A function is called using the syntax: <cb> `function_name`(...`parameters`) </cb>

For example,
</p>
<pre>
fn main = i64 (i32 x, i64 y) => {
    return x + y;
}
<comment>// This function returns 6. </comment>
fn six = i64 () => {
    return main(2, 4);
}
</pre>
<p>
To export functions so they can be run from other files, use the `export` keyword. They can then be imported from other files using "<a href="./include.html">include</a>."
</p>
<pre>
<comment>// file_one.tmb</comment>
export fn main = i64 (i32 x, i64 y) => {
    return x + y;
}
<comment>// file_two.tmb</comment>
#include main from "./file_two.tmb" as main with [i32, i64] returns i64

fn six = i64 () => {
    return main(2, 4);
}
</pre>
<p>
Code is not run directly when executed, you must define a function to be the "entry point" for the code. To do this, use the entry keyword.
</p>
<pre>
<comment>// If you compile this file and run it, `six` is the function that will run.</comment>
export fn five = i64 () => {
    return 1 + 4;
}
entry fn six = i64 () => {
    return 2 + 4;
}
</pre>
<p>
Files run this way will be passed a <cb> str </cb> parameter, containing the arguments the original file was run with.

For example, running `node test.js ARGS` will pass `ARGS` to the entry function.

If a file that uses the entry keyword is included within a project that doesn't use that file as the entry point, the entry keyword will be treated as though it were the same as the export keyword.
